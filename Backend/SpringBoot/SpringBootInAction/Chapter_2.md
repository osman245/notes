# Developing your first Springboot Application

- spring has many features that make it easier to develop a java application but Spring framework would rely on you to add all the library dependencies to the projects build specification.(maven or gradle build tool).
  And it was your job to write configuration to tell Spring what to do.

- Springboot added a level of automation to spring development. Starter dependencies and automatic configuration.

- we’re going to use Spring MVC to handle web
  requests, Thymeleaf to define web views, and Spring Data JPA to persist the reading
  selections to a database("writing code to write data to external files for future us" persistence, to keep in database for future use).

build.gradle—The Gradle build specification
■ ReadingListApplication.java—The application’s bootstrap class and primary
Spring configuration class
■ application.properties—A place to configure application and Spring Boot
properties
■ ReadingListApplicationTests.java—A basic integration test class
