# Behavioral Questions:

## Make Sure you have down pat 1-3 projects that you can talk about...

- The project had challenging components (beyond just "learning a lot").
- You played a central role (ideally on the challenging components).
- You can talk at technical depth.

## Project 1: EventBrite Project

### Challenges

### Mistakes/Failures

### Enjoyed

### Leadership

### Conflict

### What You'd do differently

In addition, ensure that you have one to three projects that you can talk about in detail. You should be able
to discuss the technical components in depth. These should be projects where you played a central role.

# What are your real weaknesses??

Give a real weakness, dont just say because you work to hard..

A good one would be ....

"Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me
execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make
sure to always have someone else double check my work."

# What questions should you ask??

Quality of questions you ask them can be a factor subconsciously or consciously, in their decision to hire you.

There are 3 types of questions....

- Genuine Questions:
  "What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?

- Insightful Questions(Demonstrate your technical knowledge of the company at hand)
  "I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"

- Passion Questions(To demonstrate passion for technology)

# Responding to Behavioural Questions

- Be specific not arrogant...

- Limit Details

- Stay tight on details and just state the key points. When possible, try to translate it or at least explain the
  impact. You can always offer the interviewer the opportunity to drill in further

(finish behavioural section today...)

- Focus on your Self not the team
  If you include a project that your team did.... focus on yourself

- Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team

- Give Structured Answers

- Do the nugget method.
  Talk about the essence of your response in the beginning of your reply.

  e.g)

  - Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change."
  - Candidate:"Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach
    their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where..."

Example:"Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate."

• Situation: On my operating systems project, I was assigned to work with three other people. While two
were great, the third team member didn't contribute much. He stayed quiet during meetings, rarely
chipped in during email discussions, and struggled to complete his components. This was an issue not
only because it shifted more work onto us, but also because we didn't know if we could count on him.
• Action: I didn't want to write him off completely yet, so I tried to resoive the situation. I did three things.
First, I wanted to understand why he was acting like this. Was it laziness? Was he busy with something
else? I struck up a conversation with him and then asked him open-ended questions about how he felt it
was going. Interestingly, basically out of nowhere, he said that he wanted to take on the writeup, which
is one of the most time intensive parts. This showed me that it wasn't laziness; it was that he didn't feel
like he was good enough to write code.
Second, now that I understand the cause, I tried to make it clear that he shouldn't fear messing up, I told
him about some of the bigger mistakes that I made and admitted that I wasn't ciear about a lot of parts
of the project either.
Third and finally, 1 asked him to help me with breaking out some of the components of the project. We
sat down together and designed a thorough spec for one of the big component, in much more detail
than we had before. Once he could see all the pieces, it helped show him that the project wasn't as scary
as he'd assumed.
• Result: With his confidence raised, he now offered to take on a bunch of the smaller coding work, and
then eventually some of the biggest parts. He finished all his work on time, and he contributed more in
discussions. We were happy to work with him on a future project.
More notes on this when i get an interview.. in ovember..
