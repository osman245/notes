# Interview Process

### StoryTime

There was a University Student, who graduated with a 3.73 gpa at a top school.
But struggled with the first round of code.

He was brilliant, although didnt prepare appropriately for the interview..

At top tech companies, algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process.

You should do your best to talk through the problem, dont be shocked if they jump in to help you... It's normal..

### Your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:

• Analytical skills: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How
long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

• Coding skills: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean
and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

• Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals: Do you have a strong foundation in computer
science and the relevant technologies?

• Experience: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging
projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
• Culture fit / Communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did
you communicate well with your interviewer?
The weighting of these areas will vary based on the question, interviewer, role, team, and company.It might be almost entirely the first three of those.

### Questions in the interview....

These interviewers select their own questions

You are graded relatively compared to others that have done that question...

If your doing a hard question, then 9/10 times other people also struggled with it as well..

If you have waited more than a week, you should follow up with your recruiter. If your recruiter does not

respond, this does not mean that you are rejected (at least not at any major tech company, and almost any other company)
